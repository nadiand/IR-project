# IR-project

This repository contains the code used for investigating whether fine-tuning a BERT model on a single dataset can help improve its intra-domain generalization capabilities and result in better document retrieval for other related datasets. This research is documented in our paper, Assessing the Generalization Abilities of a BERT-based Reranker.
